For development purposes:

To initially install, `npm install` (obviously)

Then, make sure gulp is installed globally (`npm i -g gulp`), and `gulp` in one terminal (this will run the `gulp build:all` task to populate your build folder, then run `gulp watch:all` to listen for changes and rebuild on save)

Finally, run `node` in another terminal (or, better yet, `nodemon`)
